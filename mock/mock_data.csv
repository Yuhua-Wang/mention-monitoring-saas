20869092,2017-10-08,"Beautiful apartment - I would say even nicer than the photos can show. The room was clean, minimalistic, spacious - it was everything we were expecting and more. A washing machine (plus detergent) is offered, which is great. Bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. In terms of extra amenities, there is a beautiful pool and a massage place downstairs (which, surprisingly, was not extremely expensive and had prices on par with most others I've seen in Bangkok).<br/><br/>The location is close to the BTS station but is tucked into an alley, allowing it to remain quiet. The property itself offers a free tuktuk to the BTS station or to the nearby market where you can find lots of street food vendors. <br/><br/>Suchada is extremely quick with responses and very helpful. Checking in was a seamless and easy process. <br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this property and will choose this place for future stays in Bangkok (if it's available)! ",3

20869092,2017-11-22,"I was staying as someone who needed to do some work at home. The layout of the room I stayed in at their second property had a lot of windows, which I liked.

20869092,2017-12-28,Suchada's place was lovely! It can be a bit hard for Uber drivers to find but there is a free tuk tuk that will take you to the nearby train station. You also get free noodles and there is a food delivery service that will deliver to the apartment. It's a small studio but it's perfect for a short or even extended stay. Comfortable bed and ample amount of towels.,15
20869092,2017-12-29,"Really modern convienent apartment with a lovely pool in the building for relaxing after a day in the city. Extremely close to the sky train, the apartment is also quiet due to the location in a side-street. Highly recommended.",16

20869092,2018-01-22,"Airbnb will only let me give 5 stars, but if I could I would give 10. <br/><br/>Suchada's place is one of the best AirBnb's I've ever experienced. The hospitality was second to none and the location was perfect for traveling on the BTS to different parts of the city. The location is also perfect for families since it's a bit quieter than some of the craziness of southern areas like Nana and Asok.<br/><br/>The room was a perfect size for my father and I. You can order food from the room if you'd like and there is a great massage shop in the building. <br/><br/>The staff was really quite exceptional. They arranged most of our taxis to other parts of the city as well as the airport. They even took us by tuk-tuk to a hidden little gem where the locals eat Jok (Thai breakfast rice- porridge)...AND picked us up afterwards.<br/><br/>Well done Suchada and team.",22
20869092,2018-02-05,Love the place because of the quietness!,23
20869092,2018-02-07,"This place is really nice. Specially for the price, you live where the locals live and there is a tuk tuk that can drive you to the BTS station or a little market down the street for some really good street food. Suchada is awesome very responsive and if you ask for some local tips for restaurants or places to go she knows everything.",24
20869092,2018-02-11,"Xin User Profile	<br/>Xin<br/>February 2018<br/><br/>Very nice experience! The room is spacious with daily light, the swimming pool is nice!

A five star on everything from us, would definitely recommend it. Location is also fine, in a walking distance from BTS. Staff was very friendly and polite. There is always a tuk-tuk free of charge to drive you the few hundred meters to the BTS or the local market.",28

20869092,2018-04-23,loved the local market next to the airbnb.,36
20869092,2018-04-30,"Suchada's place was nice and close to the BTS station, sanam pao, which is on stop away from victory monuement and Ari. Ari has an array of dessert cafes to visit so I highly recommend. The massage parlor downstairs is awesome and has great service. I checked in at 4am due to flight delay and immigration, but check in was smooth and I appreciate it. Suchada's team is wonderful and went out of the way to try to help me get ahold of my lost cellphone. They also help you arrange for taxi rides to the airport which is convenient. Would stay again...there's a washer! :)",37
20869092,2018-05-12,"Nice apartment, pretty stylish and clean. Looks more like a small hotel. Location is ok: quiet, but you can walk to food areas and BTS station. Plus: bananas as a compliment, several bottles of water, instant noodles.",38
20869092,2018-05-16,This was a great spot to catch up on some much needed relaxation during our backpacking trip! There is a pool on the 5th floor with an amazing city view and a spa down below the apartment.<br/><br/>We ordered food from the delivery menu but it was nothing special- probably would suggest going to a restaurant or getting some street food.,39
20869092,2018-05-18,"Centrally located; close to BTS and various shops, etc. Apartment was clean and quiet - -only apartment on said floor; same floor as gym and pool. It was convenient to be across from the Club House, for questions and access to the BTS transport service, etc. Responsive and helpful when we were unsure of how to use the Aircon.",40
20869092,2018-05-29,Great stay,41

20869092,2018-06-15,"We were actually quite surprised with how nice this place was. We really did get our money's worth. <br/>Liked:<br/>> Room was very stylish and has a minimalist feel. It was also very clean and had a complete set of toiletries and towels. <br/>> It is conveniently located near the BTS Station. They also provide a free Tuktuk service to the BTS station if you don't want to walk :) (it is only less than 5 minutes walk) and a nearby mall and marketplace.<br/>> The host is very accommodating and quickly responds to my queries.<br/>> The pool building itself has nice amenities, we really liked the pool area.<br/>> The room has its own washing machine. For the dryer, you would need to use the one in the patio which is shared by all of the residents/tenants. <br/>> They also provided free bottles for water, lots of it! <br/><br/>Area for Improvement: Though not really a big deal, but we did wish that they provided bedroom slippers for us to use while in the room. But aside from that, we did not have any other concerns.  ",44
20869092,2018-06-22,The space is exactly as pictured and the amenities are wonderful. The staff is extremely helpful and we utilized the free tuk tuk service everyday. The downstairs massage place is great too. Wonderful time!,45
20869092,2018-07-01,"The place is more than brilliant. Despite the hard-to-find location ( (Hidden by Airbnb) map is wrong), everything was good in the place just like staying in hotel. The reception staff was nice and helpful. We could have water and bananas during our stay. Washing machine and microwave were also included. The room service - meal order was cheap. One point is the curtain is outside the bathroom instead of inside (i.e. People outside can suddenly roll up the curtain while u r showering). If you do care about this then do not reserve this place.",46
20869092,2018-07-08,"This was a great spot for us - 20 minutes from both DMK and BKK airports, and just 15-20 minutes from big tourist attractions. The hospitality of the reception service was great including thoughtful touches like the address provided in Thai to keep in my wallet for taxis, and before we left they provided a free ride to the ATM by tuktuk so and helped flag a metered taxi so we could get to the airport. The apartment felt safe and was clean - great experience!",47
20869092,2018-07-15,"Suchada's apartment is an excellent place to stay in Bangkok and I highly recommend this apartment. It's spotless and you will appreciate its cleanliness. It's not very far from Sanam Pao BTS but still, if you don't want to walk you are offered free tuk-tuk service to the BTS. Suchada is a great host and she will assist you during your stay making sure you have no concern at all. This is definitely one of the best place to stay in Bangkok close to the main centers of interest. It's good value compared to hotels and some other places.",48
20869092,2018-07-18,Super place! Everything was worry-free and fantastic! ,49
20869092,2018-07-21,Perfect stay! ,50

20869092,2018-08-20,"awesome place to stay in bangkok. the place is 3 mins walking from skytrain, 3 stops away from vegetarian foodcourt and 3 stops away from siam (which is actual city center). At night it's relatively silent, apartment is cleaned regularly and reception stuff are friendly and helpfull. Overall, exceptional value for the money",54
20869092,2018-08-25,"Suchada's condo is a perfect option to stay at Bangkok, great location and very close to the metro station for easy moving around the city. The apartment is very modern and the facilities very well mantained! Thank you for the hospitality and I would recommend his condo to everyone!",55
20869092,2018-09-07,"Suchada's place was as described and all in all, a great place to stay in Bangkok. We liked the fact that there was a guard on duty, a massage place downstairs and also a Tuk Tuk service to the nearby BTS (you could walk for about 5 mins to reach Sanam Pao BTS as well). Amenities like the gym were useful and we tried the condo's order in food once during a rainy evening - the cable TV with football channels offered a great stay-in alternative during bad weather. We would recommend this place!",56
20869092,2018-09-13,"Clean, cool, and easy to access!",57
20869092,2018-09-16,"Amazingly designed space in a cool new building, very close to everywhere I needed to be in central BKK. Would stay again! Favourite part was the massage downstairs :)",58
20869092,2018-09-18,"We had an amazing stay at Suchada's! in addition to being the cleanest and nicest apartment of our trip, we were also able to leave our bags after checking out and even take a shower before taking our flight. The apartment is super well located too if you take the skytrain.",59

This apartment provides very impressive service.  I would definitely choose this place when I come back to  Bangkok. I recommend this apartment to everyone!,60
20869092,2018-09-29,"This was a really exceptional property; a hidden gem of Bangkok that far exceeded my expectations. It's luxury living in a quiet, peaceful area, that is well-connected to the beating heart of the city. The amenities are top-notch (pool, sauna etc), the communication from the team was swift and helpful, and the interior decor is stylish and homely (lots of warm colours, rather than stark white). Sensational.",61
20869092,2018-10-01,"A good distance away from all the hustle and bustle of the city centre. No overcrowded train stations or tourist-packed establishments here. If you dont mind walking just a short distance everyday to and fro the BTS, this is a great place to return home to after a long day  of shopping and eating. The receptionist is very helpful too! Not to forget, they offer a pretty tasty and diverse variety of food for room service delivery as well.",62
20869092,2018-10-03,"Great location, they provide free transport to the nearest BTS station. Just 4 stops to Siam. Spacious room, feel pretty comfortable. Nice and polite staffs. Fast responding.",63

20869092,2018-10-08,"Outstanding apartment that's beyond my expectation, it was just like in the pictures. Check in was quick and location is not difficult to find, but the walking from the BTS station might pose a problem to some guests with heavy baggages; can be averted by calling for their inhouse tuktuks.  The host was quick to respond and very well mannered!",65
20869092,2018-10-10,"A great place to start our Bangkok stay. Located in the great area of Ari, which feels lest touristy than other parts of Bangkok we visited. There are great street markets down the road (they'll drop you there for free) and the BTS station is near by which makes getting around the city easy. The actual accommodation was clean, comfortable (great bed) and the pool was fantastic. We'd definitely stay here again.",66
20869092,2018-10-11,Wonderful space to stay. Very clean and useful amenities (washer/stove top). Would definitely stay again!,67
20869092,2018-10-15,Highly recomend Suchada's place! I requested to check in early on my first day which she replied quickly and accomodated me to my timings even till the last day she gave some extra time as i needed pack my stuffs before checking out.,68
20869092,2018-10-15,Very nice room. If you want to be conected to airports the location is good. More a hotel with the nice pool and the small gym. They even cleaned the rooms if you stay longer. Very friendly and helpful staff.,69
20869092,2018-10-19,Great place to stay in Bangkok really near to the skytrain which is a must when staying in the city. The apartment is super stylish and clean. Swimming pool is clean and well maintained. Staff there are very helpful and the free tuktuk to the sky train is a nice touch. The reception is a two min walk to Bangkok Patio apartments (which are slightly larger apartments but owned by the same individual) Would recommend staying here.,70
20869092,2018-10-20,"Perfect apartment for me. Great bed, bathroom/shower and the whole apartment just right. Exactly as shown. Very clean and comfortable.<br/>Staff at nearby Bangkok Patio were very welcoming, helpful and friendly.

20869092,2018-10-26,"5 stars 5 stars 5 stars! We can't say enough great things about this apartment. We loved our 2 week stay. Suchada and the hosting team were so kind, quick with responses, easy place to find, great location (Sanam Pao station) and the size was also great for the two of us. We also loved the cleaning service that came every few days to spruce up the home. Very safe, kind security staff, overall the best place we could have booked for visiting a foreign city that we know nothing about. Thank you!",76
20869092,2018-10-29,"Apartment is near BTS (free tuk tuk to get there)<br/>Comfy bed<br/>Complete toiletries <br/>Friendly staff<br/>Microwave, electric stove, fridge, and cooking tools are provided as well.<br/>Definitely worth the price.",77

20869092,2018-10-30,sweet stay. loved it. anyone still unsure. stop. just book the hotel now!,80
20869092,2018-10-30,"Loved the location for our Bangkok stay. The condo is located in a quiet residential area, but within 5 - 10 minutes of the Skytrain, which is convenient. This location also has access to a free tuk tuk that will bring you to the Skytrain area or to the nearby market, which is such a great amenity. Speaking of amenities, the pool is lovely and having a Thai massage place on the bottom floor is a huge bonus - we went there tonight for a two hour massage and it was wonderful. The check-in was super easy and the room was actually ready early. Suchada always was quick to respond and the space has everything you need - laundry, mini kitchen, safe (which I think is rare to include but fantastic), water/snacks, and a comfortable bed. A great stay and I would stay here again!",81
20869092,2018-11-01,Better than expected. Clean and tidy. Helpful and polite staff 24/7.,82
20869092,2018-11-01,"This is Bangkok Tryp, part of Bangkok Patio just a few hundred feet away. I adored the layout, the view, the pool, and the amenities.

20869092,2018-11-05,"Suchada and her team are very hospitable. Check in was a breeze and a free tuk tuk service is provided from the apartment to the main road, which is close to BTS Sanam Phao. Those that are looking for a place which is easily accessible and move around from, this apartment is highly recommended. Just a couple of stations away from Chatuchak Market, and Pratunam Market, it's ideal for those that are here to shop without going through much of the Bangkok traffic.",86
20869092,2018-11-06,"Affordable, clean place to stay in Bangkok in the Victory Monument area! Relatively easy to get around, free tuk tuk to the sky train. Staff was very attentive and responsive.",87
20869092,2018-11-08,"I traveled to Thailand alone for a conference I joined. For the first few days, I stayed in a hotel where the conference was held together with my other fellow delegates. After the conference I decided to stay in Thailand for 2 more days to explore the city more. At first, I was very anxious cause I was alone but when I get to the place I was amazed how the staff were very nice and I love there was a guard upon entrance to the gate and a key card to scan upon entry to the building and to my room. I also love the quietness of the place and the interior. I was able to enjoy amenities in the apartment. The pool looks very luxurious and had a good swim. It was kinda bit cold at night though. Also, the bonus part is there is a Massage Place at the Ground  Floor. Its a must to try the Thai Massage. All in all my stay in this place exceeded my expectations the hosts really paid attention to the small details which was greatly appreciated. Would definitely go back to this place.",88
20869092,2018-11-08,Einfach nur perfekt! Das Appartement bietet alles was das Herz begehrt. Super Lage direkt an der BTS station Sanam pao. Suchada lies uns im Vorfeld eine genau weg Beschreibung zu kommen. Wir haben so schnell alles gefunden! TukTuk zur BTS ist inklusive. Alles top!,89

20869092,2018-11-23,"We stayed in a serviced apartment in a building called Bangkok Tryp. Upon arrival from the Sky Train (9 min walk from the station) we checked in at a different building to get our key. The person at the desk walked us over to our room  (just a couple minutes away walking) and made sure we had everything we needed. There was cold bottled water in the fridge and they provided print outs of the address in Thai for taxi drivers in case we needed it. The building was quiet, clean, and very modern in its decor. The amenities seemed awesome - massage downstairs, a pool and fitness center - but we did not have time to take advantage of them on this visit. The neighborhood was really interesting and I would have liked more time to explore. Would definitely stay there again!",101

20869092,2018-11-27,"Don't order from the menu provided in the room....we ordered 5 different things but all of it wasn't good at all. Much better to go and look for food in the surrounding area. The pool was amazing though and the place was clean and had a good view. if you are looking for activities to do in Bangkok, better to do research on your own....the staff at the reception desk helped us a bit but they gave us overpriced quotes that were not worth it",107
20869092,2018-11-28,Fast response and very good  hospitality. The room is just same as Airbnb. Highly recommend!,108
20869092,2018-11-28,I would highly recommend this condo!  Easy check in and felt safe during our stay.  The entry is gated with a security guard in front at all times throughout the morning and night.  The space was very spacious much more spacious then I expected.  Highly recommend!,109

Not only is the air bnb clean, modern, stylish and filled with every amenity, but the front desk staff are so friendly and helpful! We loved the ability to do laundry, having access to the pool, and the nice touches such as free water, coffee and noodles. The staff answered any questions we had and they even have a free tuk tuk to take you to the train station. This air bnb is close to the train station which was our quickest way to get around. We loved staying here and highly recommend it!",113
20869092,2018-12-02,It was a great modern apartment. Had a washer in the apartment but we did not use it. Everything was very clean. Away from the noise of Bangkok but close enough to grab a taxi. Would definitely recommend. They even checked us in early :)) thank you!!,114
20869092,2018-12-02,The location is a bit far from the downtown area of bang kok but was close to the train station so you can use public transportation. There is a tuk tuk service provided at the Bangkok patio lobby area that brings you to the main road because this building is a bit discrete. The host is amazing! They responded quickly and is very accommodating. Would definitely recommend!!,115

20869092,2018-12-09,Suchada's place was a very nice spot to call home during our short trip to Bangkok.  The staff at the building were very friendly and helpful with checking in and checking out.  The building pool on the 5th floor was also a particularly nice amenity.  We couldn't have asked for a better location (seemed fairly central and easy to get everywhere).  The apartment's proximity to the sky rail also made transportation a lot more convenient.,123

I loved everything about it and I have already suggested this place to people who intend on traveling to Thailand.",147
20869092,2019-01-05,"Suchadas place was amazing, very clean and modern, with the added bonus of a rooftop pool. Had no problems finding the place as it is very close to the Sanam Pao BTS station which is northbound (towards Mo Chit) on the Green line. The ladies at checkin at the Bloom serviced apartments were very efficient and helpful, and took me around the corner about 2 minutes walk to the Trypp building where the apartment was. <br/>The bed was amazingly comfy, the shower was great and there were black out blinds also so a great night sleep is guaranteed!! <br/>The only downside was that the pool was a little on the chilly side, and those expecting a fully equipped gym will be a little disappointed, there being just a couple of rowing machines there. However, on the whole the apartment far surpassed my expectations. Many thanks for a great stay.",148
20869092,2019-01-07,"The place is good but not wonderful. Check-in and check-out were fast, the receptionist gave us the card and showed the apartment. The place is near to elevator so you can hear the irritating bleep-bleep sounds all the time.",149

20869092,2019-01-08,"Love Suchada's place! Everything is just like the pics shown. All my queries are promptly responded to. The place is approx 5 mins walk to Sanam pao bts. There is a small 7-11 beside the bts. If u can't walk up the stairs, would recommend to walk abit further down to take the escalator up the bts. There is market and small stalls selling fruits, noodles & thai food near the apartment. Just 10 mins walk. Else u can request for complimentary tuktuk service to fetch u there. There are two 7-11 which are bigger than the one beside bts & a Tops market. Do look for a small stall selling mixed pork soup (gao lao leuad moo). Aroi mak! There are complimentary bottled waters & instant noodles in the apartment which we really appreciate. Didn't hv the chance to try the massage downstairs which opens frm 10am to 9pm. There is a small swimming pool & gym at level 5 if you wanna burn off some calories during yr trip. All in all everything is great at Suchada's place. The only thing small prob is the basin in the toilet. The water will splash out if u turn on the tap too much.",152

20869092,2019-01-14,Enjoyed my 1 night stay.  it's close to the BTS station (Sanam Pao) which is also close to all the major malls and shopping/dining options as well as other attractions.  There's not a lot in the immediate area but that didn't bother me as it was quiet and it was a short BTS ride away from most everything.,162

20869092,2019-01-16,"An absolute gem! Suchada and the team were extremely helpful and kind, from the moment we checked in until we left.

Everything was clean and the bed was very comfy. Would definitely stay here again!",164
20869092,2019-01-16,Clean place with a peaceful environment. It's a short walk to the BTS station but the road leading to it is quite narrow with abit of traffic. Other option is to take the free tuk-tuk. Good massage place underneath the building but closes early at 9pm. Overall comfortable stay.,165
20869092,2019-01-18,"Very homely apartment, very clean, good facilities such as washing machine, fridge full of water, fast wifi. Right next to skytrain, which was helpful. Would definitely stay again.",166

It was a little tough to find tuk tuk's going out as the place was a little bit in between allys but if you download Grab app its pretty easy to request a Grab to pick you up. Closest breakfast was in another hotel/apartment lobby, they had good coffee and small pastries and its a really cute cafe.",167
20869092,2019-01-18,"DO NOT BOOK. PHOTOS EXTREMELY MISLEADING. There were different levels of rooms to book so we paid more to get a bigger room with outdoor tub. Despite that, the tub was dirty, the room was not big, in fact super tiny and felt like a prison with no windows or ventilation. The room has a bad stench. The shower was mouldy and we found a lizard in the room.",168

We stayed here for seven nights and there was a cleaning service once every 2/3 days. Access to the pool was great. Location is ideal, five minutes away from Sanam Pao BTS station. We ended up taking the BTS everywhere. Would definitely recommend staying here.",173

The cabinet and shelves area are dusty. The most uncomfortable point is the attitude of the staffs, no mention for the public facilities to us eg. swimming pool. It隆炉s no worth for the price in conclusion.",183

20869092,2019-03-12,Highly recommend. thoughtful.,225
20869092,2019-03-12,"Great place to stay in Bangkok. Whereas other places booked via AirBnB can be sketchy in Thailand due to laws regarding daily rentals, this place is run more like a hotel and felt very comfortable and legit. We checked in in the middle of the night and were greeted and shown to our room quickly and without issue. The room was also equipped with everything we needed, bed was comfortable, the place is a few minutes walk from a 7-11, local shops, and the BTS station. There's also a great massage place on the ground level that we used several times during our short stay.",226
20869092,2019-03-13,"great place! better than expected. <br/>clean, super friendly and everything was made with ease. beautiful pool area. paid $350baht from taxi to apartment and $500baht back to airport. a little out from the main city area but all in all an enjoyable stay!!",227
20869092,2019-03-13,"Poor cleanliness and facility! I booked a 6D5N and the first day was horrid! - Shower head, bathroom door and air con was spoilt. -Table area was dirty and dusty. - Did not provide hand soap? I am genuinely concerned about the hygiene of the kettle. - Toothpaste was a joke. There is a tight seal instead of a cap? How do you expect your customer to open it? - There is drilling and I could hear people screaming and shouting like no tomorrow every morning / afternoon. The shower head and air con was fixed but wow. Worst hotel I have ever stayed at hands down. I never wanted a refund for a hotel so badly.",228

20869092,2019-03-21,Sound proofing is bad. Is really annoying when somebody is walking pass or opening or closing they door. No parking space. The nearest parking will be multi stores parking 2 blocks away or road side隆颅 Towel is yellowish and old隆颅 Bath room with stain隆颅 Most importantly the price doesn隆炉t match what they are offering.,238

20869092,2019-03-22,"Thank you for such an amazing experience. The apartment was better than I expected. The location and accessibility to the sky train was awesome; easy access to airport and mall and other places. The amenities were good. Loved  that you provided detergent for the washer and pots and pan for the stove. Great communication, what I liked the most was how clean this place was. The gym only has a tread mill and 2 bicycles. I was expecting more equipment.",240
20869092,2019-03-22,Very nice apartment located close to the SkyTrain stop Sanam Pao with very nice and helpful staff. The pool is a highlight! Would recommend it,241

20869092,2019-03-27,I was kicked out of the room when I was was. All my stuff were put in to the bag with out thinking of the sensitivity of the item inside. I had stayed here more than 30 days. This is one of worst experience I had with them,249
20869092,2019-03-28,Beautiful apartment! So convenient for getting around the city with the BTS. Would really recommend this place!,250
20869092,2019-03-29,"We stayed one night in this wonderful apartment. The staff was super friendly and helpful! <br/>On our checkout day, we were able to stay longer in the pool area, which really helped us as our international flight was leaving late at night only. <br/>I would definitely recommend staying here for one or more nights!",251
20869092,2019-03-29,Worst hotel i ever encounter! Feel so disgusted.. and the room smell bad.. and the toilet so small,252

20869092,2019-04-04,"Didn't have a good experience staying here. Firstly there's no receptionist although the reception is supposed to be open. We booked for @com but was reallocated to @SG and we were greeted with cigarette smell in the facility. Then there's someone who used our pod to put their toiletries. The pod was run down and had holes, with questionable stains on the bed sheet. The shared bathroom was a bit run down and there's cigarette ash on the floor too. There's no privacy to bathroom cause the back door is left open. And there's lots of people staying long term there and they're washing dishes in the bathroom.",260
20869092,2019-04-05,Cosy place to stay!,261
20869092,2019-04-05,"Apartment as described, friendly staff :)",262
20869092,2019-04-05,"This is a perfect place to stay if you are looking for a couple nights in Bangkok. <br/><br/>Close to sky train to get around the city, just a 4 minute walk, or they have a dedicated complimentary Tuk Tuk which can drive you quickly to anywhere within a few minutes. The space itself was clean, presented perfectly, and of a good size, with everything you need to hand, and although we did not need anything else, the reception team were just over the road and very helpful. <br/><br/>The additional perks of a swimming pool and gym were a well welcomed extra which we used just the once on our short stay - but again fantastic. <br/><br/>I would not hesitate to stay here on multiple occasions again. Thank you to our host and the team they have looking after the rooms.",263
20869092,2019-04-06,"My husband and I were only there about 12 hours during a long layover but in that time, we were able to locate shopping, easily access the BTS, and have a couple of meals. This is a great location and the staff is outstanding. I wish I could have stayed longer but will definitely stay here again.",264
20869092,2019-04-07,Exteremely Bad. We need to ask staff to clean the room. Sometimes they won't come on their own. No Laptop Table Provided. Front Desk Staff is not Friendly at all. Better to go for ibis Budget.,265
20869092,2019-04-07,"Recently very bad experience with this hotel. Cockroaches in the bedroom and bathroom, stains on bed sheet,s, towels. When asked for room change got a very rude answer from staff. So we cut our stay short. No apologies",266
20869092,2019-04-08,"Nice location,nice environment",267
20869092,2019-04-09,Worst hotel in my life. I do not recommend in any way,268
20869092,2019-04-10,We had a great time at Suchadas! Check in was so easy and communication was simple with her. The apartment is in an ideal location close to the BTS. The place was sparkling clean with welcoming touches.... after our lives ng flight the washing machine inside the apartment was a God-send. The pool area was also gorgeous. We would highly recommend it...the only downfall was that we didn't book a longer stay there!,269
20869092,2019-04-12,Highly recommendable!,270
20869092,2019-04-12,"Very unpleasant experience stayed at this place. -One of Indian Security on duty was so rude, no manners to start the conversation with hotel guest.. First thing come out from his mouth was ""who are you and what are you doing here"".. -3 of us checked into 3 rooms but unfortunately the A/C is not working. Complaint to front desk and after quite sometimes, we have to call back to ask what is the status and they replied those section is actually having a problem with the air-condition. Why on earth put us in that section in the first place when your technician already know those section A/C not working!!",271
20869092,2019-04-12,The worst bedding I ever encountered in a hotel. Both the mattress pad and the duvet are full of hard lumps. Feels like sleeping on a bed of balls. Asked the service men to change for me however all the replacements they brought are the same. Quiet surprised no previous review mentioned the poor bedding. My Christmas staycation is ruin!,272
20869092,2019-04-13,Great place!,273
20869092,2019-04-14,Everything was fine!!,274
20869092,2019-04-14,Great,275
20869092,2019-04-14,"As people say first impression is your last impression. But here it's worst, started with bad reception then worst possible room with dirty carpet, no hot water, bad plugs for charging, not proper toiletries in bathroom and so on. Would not recommend it to any one. No option to give 0 or negative stars.",276
20869092,2019-04-15,"Suchada's was great.  Close to the train, street food options and even a few good coffee spots, including one almost hidden, next door at Abloom.",277
20869092,2019-04-15,The room is large enough for a family trip or a couple.,278
20869092,2019-04-17,I stayed at this hotel yesterday and my stay was worst.,279
20869092,2019-04-18,"Its beautiful and stylish. Although I take Grab most the time while living there,  its very near to BTS and just few stops to the central. I would consider to visit again.:)",280
20869092,2019-04-18,"This is my first airbnb experience and trip to Thailand. I was glad that this first trip was a success having chosen Suchada's apartment.<br/><br/><br/>If i can describe this booking in one word, it would be details. The amount of attention put into little details are astonishing, and it definitely helped made this trip a satisfying one. Such as the free tuk tuk services, food delivery, the provided hygiene necessities and free provided bottled water.<br/><br/>I would definitely love to come back again. Staff were super professional, and can all understand English well. Some tips for people looking to stay here i would give is:<br/><br/>-Getting a sim card that allows you to make phone call and you can call the tuk tuk to pick you up from the bts instead of walking back.<br/><br/>-If you are taking grab, instead of inputting the address provided, simply search ""bangkok tryp"" or ""bangkok patio"" for a more accurate destination.<br/><br/>Cheers!",281
20869092,2019-04-20,"This was a perfect place for us to stay in Bangkok, plenty of amenities, very close to the sky train and easy to get Grab taxi also to anywhere in the city and the airport. Would definitely stay again!",282
20869092,2019-04-20,"Really nice apartment with all the comfort in a quiet and convenient location. The service counter for the check in and check out is very pleasant. The ladies were very helpful and the tuk-tuk service very practical. We enjoyed a refreshing swim in the pool. And the help getting a big taxi to get to the airport was a plus. There is space to store things and a big fridge, if you stay long.  We might come back to this apartment.",283
20869092,2019-04-21,Great space and very good location. Complementary water was offered.,284
20869092,2019-04-22,"Area is near Sanam Pao BTS, thus it is convenient to get around. There were nice cafes nearby. <br/>The host was thoughtful to stock up the fridge with water and cup noodles.",285
20869092,2019-04-22,"Great place to stay! Was easy to get to from BKK airport via Airport Rail Link and BTS. Does take a while to get to the central sites, but did mean we could take a canal boat to get to the centre, which was a shortish walk away! We arrived a few hours before check-in, but were allowed to use the pool and other facilities whilst the room was attended to.",286
20869092,2019-04-22,"This space was one of the best! I would definitely consider staying here again next time I come to Bangkok. The check in was really easy, I arrived late at 4 am and there was still someone there to check me in. They offered lots of free water bottles in the fridge which was great for hot Bangkok weather. It is near Sanam Pao BTS so getting around is easy and there is even a free tuk tuk service to take you to the station if you don't want to walk for 5 minutes. The tuk tuk also take you to this amazing local market that has LOADS of authentic street food!!! Don't even get me started on the gorgeous modern room itself encase and surrounded by windows and lush grounds. Simply amazing!!",287
20869092,2019-04-22,"Poor room service, rooms were cleaned once in 3 days",288
20869092,2019-04-23,"Very old and dated, room has cockcroach, dryer is not working and the water flush is not working properly as well. Apparently the employee knew the room has been sprayed for cockroaches yet asking me to take a photo to show it to her....very unpleasant experience, would not go there again.",289

20869092,2019-05-02,"The Suchada team was very nice and helpful when we had questions. The location is conveniently close to the train station (4 min walk). They provided a tuk tuk to the local market and train station which was nice. The room was clean, and bed was comfortable. Washing machine worked fine. Swimming pool was nice, but the view was just okay from the pool. Overall, a fantastic stay",303
20869092,2019-05-02,"Small room,small bathroom,poor cleanliness,unfriendly staff. I booked and payed for a standar room with windows,but the staff try to give me a no windows room,but fortunately there were only rooms with windows avialable.

20869092,2019-05-05,"bad very bad hotel and dormitory. have no space to stand. you have to done everything on the bad in the room because no space has to stand. they don隆炉t provide any shop or shampoo. They didn隆炉t give us tee and coffee though that was included in room facilities. Totally worst of moneys. Hot water system was not working. Eventually After complaint they don隆炉t repair. very sad is that they didn隆炉t refund if you refused to stay there. once you pay to them you lose your money. please see room space before booking. no space to put your luggage, no window. in the name of dorm room they give you a pit. so before booking please be careful.",311

20869092,2019-05-06,"My advice..Make sure you read all the negative reviews before you book as they are all TRUE! Especially on the remarks of the reception隆炉s attitude, room conditions, photos don隆炉t review the actual conditions etc..I made a mistake by reading only the 隆庐positive reviews隆炉. If you want to have an enjoyable stay, book somewhere else even if you have to pay more.",315
20869092,2019-05-07,Good location and close to the BTS. Will recommend anyone to stay here if they decide to take a short trip here.,316

20869092,2019-05-15,1. Hotel staff are poorly trained on customer service. 2. Unprofessional and openly utterly rude. 3. Can't give a room even after booking was done. Told me to find another establishment which I did. And they didn't cancel my booking with them. 4. No details were asked. 5. Manger on duty had that same unprofessional unethical way of working. I would love to compliment (Value hotel nice) Staff there are excellent welcoming and warm.,327
20869092,2019-05-16,"Coming back to Suchada's apartment after a day out in the heat of Bangkok was such a treat.

Suchada replies us as soon as possible when we have any question, such as borrowing an adaptor plug and asking to fix the television. The massage service is also provided with an affordable price and it is just on the ground floor of the apartment. We will recommend this Airbnb to our friends for sure and will choose this apartment if we come to Thailand again. Thank you.",348

20869092,2019-05-31,"We had such a phenomenal experience! The partner hotel that assists with checking in gave us a complimentary ride to our hotel with our luggage, guided us to our room (which was the only room on the 5th floor with the pool and gym), she provided such excellent customer service and there is ROOM SERVICE. The place was so beautiful, the bed was so comfy, we were able to wash our clothes (there was laundry detergent available) and dry them with an easy to use rack. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone!",353
20869092,2019-06-01,Great host with excellent service from the team. Request were seamless and tuk tuk to BTS is a bonus.,354
20869092,2019-06-01,We loved our stay here. The location was great and the apartment was clean and had everything we needed. We loved having access to a lovely pool as well as the amazing massage place below the apartments! We followed the instructions from the listing to get the train in from the airport to the apartment and found it really easily. Thanks Suchada and team!,355
20869092,2019-06-04,"Had a lovely stay here! The room is just as described and sooo close to BTS (4 minute walk) and the reception lady was so so nice and helpful, I would highLu recommend :)",356
20869092,2019-06-08,Great location,357
20869092,2019-06-09,"Don隆炉t waste your time with this hotel. So unprofessional, untidy and unpleasant attitude of staff.",358
20869092,2019-06-11,The apartment was very clean and modern. It was within walking distance to a local market.,359
20869092,2019-06-12,The hotel exceeded expectations for comfort.  We will continue to stay next time.,360
20869092,2019-06-13,Very nice,361
20869092,2019-06-13,The apartment was perfect for us. You have nice People on the reception and you just walk a few minutes to BTS-station. If I ever come back to Bangkok i will book this airbnb again!!! Thank you so much,362

20869092,2019-06-13,Suchada direct us from BKK airport to her place using the sky train and it is easy to get there. She always respond to your questions in minutes. They offer a tuk tuk ride to the train station. we got there early in the morning so they offer a luggage storage so we can go and explore before check in time. They will call a taxi for you if you need it. Would stay at her place again.,365
20869092,2019-06-14,Near Sanam Pao BTS. Spacious room and the water pressure in the bathroom is good. Good reception and sufficient bottled water. Recommended.,366
20869092,2019-06-15,Great place to stay- about a 5 min walk to the BTS line and they offer free tuk tuk rides to the station. Spacious for two people. The staff was very friendly and made it feel like a hotel stay. Gym and pool were nice perks- small but had the basics.,367
20869092,2019-06-15,"Suchada's place is great. We were the only room on the fifth floor, which also had the pool. It felt like a private floor, but the pool is shared. So our second night a few individuals from another room were using it late at night and it was a bit distruptive for us. We did ask them to quiet down and it was okay. The room is small, but a decent size for two. It was clean, and stocked with water in the fridge, which was so lovely. She also had instant noodles, in case we were hungry. <br/><br/>The bed was comfortable, the shower pressure was okay, and she has a washer in the room as well. The TV did stop working the second day, but we were too tired to deal with it. I'm sure if I messaged Suchada about it, it would have been dealt with. It's a good location to get around, but Grab had a difficult time getting to it. We often had to meet our driver downstairs when they were delivering food. There is also only one key, which made it hard if one person left and the other was in the shower or something. You required the key for powering lights in the room. <br/><br/>There is a spa at the entrance of the building, which my husband and I enjoyed immensely! Overall, really happy with this choice. Definitely would recommend!",368
20869092,2019-06-15,"The apartment was clean, neat and the staff were very helpful.   It was setup as a hotel plus more. The  bottled water in the refrigerator was much appreciated as was the availability of the tuktuk to bring you to and fetch you from the BTS station.  Would stay here again if i get a chance to go back to Bangkok.",369
20869092,2019-06-15,Very poor I am stay 1 week no housekeeping,370
20869092,2019-06-15,The hotel doesnt have any facilities and poor service. The front office doesnt seem to have training on how to handle customers. Not friendly and NOT so accommodating with all the details of the logistics to use csg so because of that miscommunication is inevitable .,371
20869092,2019-06-16,"An amazing flat just a three minute walk to the BTS - perfect! The staff at reception are lovely and so willing to help. They fixed a small maintenance issue in a couple of hours and offered a free tuktuk service to the nearest station. Beautiful place, it was a joy staying there - great aircon and loads of water provided!",372
20869092,2019-06-17,"Very good stay. The apartment is in a nice area, which isn't massively touristy but only 3 minutes from the BTS skytrain, which is very trip and allows easy access to everywhere in Bangkok!",373
20869092,2019-06-18,"I'm a frequent visitor to Bangkok & my 4th airbnb apartment in Bangkok. And Suchada apartment is so far the best one I've stayed in so far & definitely return in my next trip!<br/><br/>I love the apartment because <br/>it is just a short 5-10 mins walk (2 mins tuk tuk ride - almost no waiting time); the staffs are very friendly and helpful; they provided generous amount of drinking water in the fridge; the hairdryer is the better ones; lots of channel to watch when I was in the room; clean and spacious apartment, wifi was decent, 2 aircons in the whole apartment.<br/><br/>I am really impressed when the aircon was leaking, it got fixed almost immediately (there were once I stayed in an airbnb and it didn't get fixed at all). And after checking out, we're able to take shower at L3 too. Lastly, there is a clothes rack for us to hang the clothes after we wash it and they gave more than enough hangers and a rack for us to hang the clothes as well (which most airbnb apartment don't do). Tuk Tuk service is also more efficient than most airbnb or even service apartment I have stayed before.<br/><br/>This apartment is almost a hotel except without the daily cleaning which I don't need. Every 3 days was good enough! However, if you're looking for a place right in the midst of the shopping, this is not the place. It is 3 stops away from siam and chaktuchak. Which for me, is very convenient. And it was so convenient we took the airport rail link and change to BTS which cost only 65 baht each and 45 mins for us to reach the apartment. Rather than 400 baht to grab and get stuck in the jam for 1.5 - 2 hours. <br/><br/>My husband and I had a very enjoyable 6D5N stay at Bangkok TRYP! Their response has also been very prompt! <br/><br/>Also, you could check out Thanee Restaurant (local food at walking distance 850m?) for breakfast. We love the roast pork there! <br/><br/>Thank you to Suchada Team for making our trip so enjoyable!",374
20869092,2019-06-19,"Service was bad, queued for 40 mins to check-in when there was only one group in front. Asked for late check-out since they wasted so much of our time due to their inefficiency in checking in, but were declined rudely. The room was very dusty and there was no body soap in the given receptacle. Isn't it basic service to refill the essentials before every new guest uses the room? Only good point is the location - there are many eateries nearby.",375
20869092,2019-06-19,Horrible hotel and staff service. What a bad experience. Rude and bad communication staff.,376
20869092,2019-06-21,"Great place to stay and has a very nice pool. Staff was also super nice and check-in process was a breeze. Even after checking out, they offers to store our luggages in case we were still exploring. We really appreciated it!",377
20869092,2019-06-22,"A well-satisfied experience!! So clean, so convenient to BTS! Recommend to live there :)",378
20869092,2019-06-22,Nice,379
20869092,2019-06-22,Clean and big apartment to stay in. Check in was smooth and staff was very polite. Transport provided to the BTS although the BTS was already quite near. Convenient if you are going chatuchak market. Highly recommended!,380

20869092,2019-07-03,"Great place, about 4 minutes walk from Sanam Pao station but the host provides a free tuktuk ride 1 way to the station from the apartment. There's also a great massage place downstairs, would stay again!",388
20869092,2019-07-04,"This is a great place to stay to experience Bangkok. The building was clean and well located, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and they have free tuk tuk rides to the sky train and market! The bed was extremely comfortable and the pool was definitely a plus for the hot days. Overall, my friend and I had a great time staying here.",389
20869092,2019-07-04,"Everything is just as it appears in the listing. There is no need to contact the owner as the property managers are always available, friendly and can easily help with any of your needs. The apartment is well maintained, comfortable, easily accessed and in a good location.",390
20869092,2019-07-04,"Location is good, but again隆颅 location good, service is bad, especially the receptionist who should be the one who most friendly and helpful in the hotel were very disappointed. Will never back again and will never recommend it to friends and family.",391

20869092,2019-07-06,"We were upgraded at the last minute to a better room right next to the pool, the place was very spacious and luxurious. Very convenient to be so close to a BTS skytrain stop. They arranged a taxi for us to get to the train station after our stay, as well as holding our bags before our check in and after our check out.",394
20869092,2019-07-07,"Space was clean & the check in process was fairly easy. They had a take-out menu for delivery to the room which is a fantastic touch, especially for after a long day of shopping and you just want to stay in.<br/><br/>The tuktuk service to the BTS was another nice touch, and the shared concierge with their nearby serviced apartments made a huge difference in experience, especially for an AirBnb.<br/><br/>Only one downside is the distance to travel to the main tourist areas, but it's still fairly near by BTS.",395
20869092,2019-07-07,"Bad hotel, humidity was too high that the bed sheet was feeling wet every moment, the floor was sticky,water splits out from the door when you bath and the room was smelly. Don't ever stay in this hotel!",396

20869092,2019-07-09,"This place is absolutely stunning, amenities are gorgeous, very well located (although hard to find the first time), super clean and there's always someone available to assist you for whatever you may need. For the price you pay you will absolutely love it.",399

20869092,2019-07-14,"Excellent room! The condo is as described and as you see it on the photos. I would emphasise the great attitude of Suchada in responding all messages quickly and the staff working at the condominium. It's a great location, near bts and 7/11, but I found food options to be a bit limited (in case you like very busy areas with tones of options).",407
20869092,2019-07-14,"A great place to stay in Bangkok. The check in was easy, the tuktuk to the BTS and market was an added bonus.

20869092,2019-07-15,Booked multiple rooms for my visiting guests who arrived at different dates. Our first arriving of over 10 guests checked in smoothly. Somehow stupid Genting refused to allow next few arriving guests to check-in because they now claimed person who made reservations must be present. So how about tour group? Thats obviously no true because we make over hundreds of reservations every year for our guests and this is the first time we encounter such issue.,410
20869092,2019-07-16,This space is located in a trendy fun area of town. It's not full of tourists so its less crowded. We had a great time walking to boat noodle alley and taking cabs to see the attractions.,411

20869092,2019-07-27,Enjoyed my stay,426
20869092,2019-07-27,"If there is a 0 rating, it would be that. The place is so old and torn and dirty and musty... it's basically a health hazard! They don't even have bottled water, they gave us a pitcher of water, in which the pitcher was so old and dirty! The latch on the door was broken, we did not feel safe at all.",427

20869092,2019-08-05,The BNB was a really great place to stay in. The facilities were good and check in and out was really fast and efficient.

A definite to come back to stay in Bangkok Tryp. :),438

20869092,2019-08-11,Clean and comfortable space for two travellers. Check in was great. They provided mineral water during our stay. There is also a complimentary tuk tuk service to bring us to Sanam Pao BTS. The service staff were friendly and helpful. <br/>Good value for money.<br/>Book only if you do not mind not being in the center of town.<br/>Wifi connectivity can be improved.,445

20869092,2019-08-21,Wonderful apartment with great location and pool. We are happy to book the apartment here in a great deal.,460
20869092,2019-08-22,"A very pleasure, comfortable, and delicate studio! Great place to stay with the friendly host and great location.",461

20869092,2019-08-24,The space was very clean and relaxing. The staff was really helpful and very kind as well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable space to travel from.,463
20869092,2019-08-24,"Travelled as a couple for 4 days and we stayed in Bangkok Tryp. Communication with the Suchada was kept open and response from her very fast. Check- in process was smooth and apartment is very clean which I was very pleased to see.<br/><br/>Room: Very clean, stocked up with bottled water, plates, mugs, towels etc. Our aircon was slightly leaking, but it was not a big deal. Bed was superb and very comfortable. <br/><br/>Location: There is tuk tuk on call to take you near the BTS Sanam Pao ( very convenient to go anywhere) , however it doesn't go all the way to the station, it is a short 3-5 mins walk. The only part that is lacking is if you do not have a local number you can't contact the reception to page the Tuk tuk to pick you up and the walk back to Bangkok Tryp can be a little tideous especially with luggage due to the ongoing traffic as it is pretty deep down the alley. <br/><br/>Overall, it is a fantastic place to stay if you prefer a quieter neighbourhood away from the buzzing crowd. <br/><br/>Suchada and her team did a great job and we had a great experience staying in this apartment.",464
20869092,2019-08-26,Plz save your money and time. Dont stay here and experience the worst hotel experience. No proper wifi and terrible food in history,465

20869092,2019-08-29,"Initially I wanted to leave a generic review for this stay, but Sutchada's place has been really amazing. It was relatively near to the Sanam Pao BTS and the tuk tuk service was really helpful and always ready for us. The space is neat and beautiful and the bed was especially comfortable. We had a lovely time in Bangkok and would definitely recommend Sutchada's place to anyone looking to have an amazing stay.",470
20869092,2019-08-31,Staff are very helpful and we spent 2 wonderful nights there. Property is close to BTS and 7-11. Recommended for people don't stay at Bangkok for too long.,471

20869092,2019-09-05,"This place will not disappoint, the pics are very accurate, it's clean and stylish, the staff are great and so helpful if you need anything.<br/>I am very fussy where I stay but I would not hesitate to stay here again. It's literally round the corner from the bts station so really easy to get around.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 from me and my wife",481
20869092,2019-09-05,This was a great place to stay.  We walked to a non-touristy local market within 10 minutes.  Everything was clean and comfortable.,482

20869092,2019-09-09,"Beautiful apartment close to the skytrain. Great service and modern interior, free Tuk-Tuk service from/to BTS available. There are some special regulations regarding the usage of the pool area, make sure to check with your host in advance. Overall we would recommend this location and will likely come back.",487
20869092,2019-09-09,This placeis beautiful. Theres a lot of street food and shopping malls around!,488
20869092,2019-09-09,"First of all, wi-fi is so terrible. You cannot even watch something on Youtube without stress except the case of you wanna watch with 144p. Housekeeping is also not really awesome. Gym is so tiny.",489
20869092,2019-09-10,"The accommodation is cosy for 2. They provide amenities like microwave, washing machine and also have access to pool and gym. Tuk tuk service is available from the accom to the BTS which is a great plus after long day of shopping. Highly recommended!",490

20869092,2019-09-15,Fantastic place! Everything was nice and clean and felt more like a hotel with the check in / check out process. Didn't stay long enough to check out the pool and gym. They also have a free tuktuk service where they drive you to the local market or BTS station otherwise it's less than 10 min walk.,496
20869092,2019-09-16,My partner and I stayed here for 1 night after arriving from a late flight into Bangkok. The apartment was clean and conveniently located near the skytrain. It's a bit out of the main city centre but since Bangkok is a large city with lots of traffic the proximity to the skytrain is ideal. The bed was also big and very comfy!,497
20869092,2019-09-16,Nice quiet area short walk to restaurants at a bargain price.,498
20869092,2019-09-16,"So bad. Requested some hangers, they can only provide one and so dirty. They even don't know it should be cleaned before passing to guest.",499

20869092,2019-09-17,"I was thoroughly impressed by the great hospitality this establishment provided for me and my friends. This was definitely worth the money, and I wish we stayed longer here. Loved how they had a tuk tuk service for us to the local market/train station. It was also in a really quiet area so we could have a break from the city noise. I especially loved the infinity pool/gym. We used these spaces to take a break from hours of long sightseeing and the views from the pool were spectacular. That bed was also really comfortable, I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud! This was overall a great experience, and I recommend this to anyone who wants an affordable yet luxurious experience.",503
20869092,2019-09-18,"Great place to have a good rest, clean and the location is not that center but in the SkyTrain everything is in 20 minutes",504
20869092,2019-09-18,"This hotel has very poor service, the poor area has a lot of mosquitoes, the room service very bad some days give you water sometimes not and towels too",505
20869092,2019-09-18,"A very bad experience at this hotel. It was our first trip to Singapore. They serve same disgusting breakfast everyday. Receptionist is very rude. Coming to the room, the tv did not work, the shower broke down, no proper locks to the bathroom. I would never go back to that place.",506

20869092,2019-09-19,"Overall it has been a great experience living here at Bangkok Tryp. <br/>The room provided is very clean and well equipped with washing machine, electronic stoves, and TV (with lots of TV channels). We are very surprised as they even provided us detergents for us to wash our clothes inside the room. They also provide all tuk tuk pick up and drop off services to Sanam Pao (Nearest BTS station). Will definitely come back to stay if I ever visit Bangkok again!",509
20869092,2019-09-20,"Easy to check in, massage parlour available just downstairs and also have room service in the room. Bed is extremely comfortable and place is huge",510

20869092,2019-09-24,Clean room and nice touches. Good hospitality and not a bad location. Pool is okay. They provide free tuk tuk to sanam pao bts which is also 5-8min walking distance. Overall a pleasant stay!,514
20869092,2019-09-25,A lovely and spacious Airbnb in a good location. Suchada was prompt with questions and responses. The place was clean and near the train. Check in and check out was quick and simple. It was away from the main road so it was quiet at night. I would highly recommend this place for a stay in Bangkok! Thank you Suchada.,515
20869092,2019-09-25,"Amazing stay. Easy BTS access, close to victory monument, overall great location. We enjoyed the tuk tuk service and the management being available for guidance throughout our stay",516

20869092,2019-10-03,Fantastic place!,520
20869092,2019-10-05,"It's not a hotel at all just a bed like dormitories if you will keep your trolley bag down then there won't be space to keep your legs that much small. Neat and clean but I feel like in a sleeper couch in the train, bath room and toilet are common. I never suggest this place to anyone",521
20869092,2019-10-06,"Very nice and beautiful place more than I expected. Swimming pool and gym room is useful after a long and tiring day. Room have washing machine and kitchen and stuffs, very very convenient.",522

20869092,2019-10-08,"Terrible service. Booked a night there and tried to alter the dates on Agoda but accidentally clicked a button and cancelled it and requested for it to be reinstated. Agoda team was fab but customer service was horrible - not only was the request denied, but they were awfully rude about it and had condescending tones. It was my first time experience and will definitely not book this place again. There are plenty of other options around",525
20869092,2019-10-08,"Food was horrible, in the pandemic situation they are making money by giving sub standard food.",526
20869092,2019-10-09,"Very clean and nice apartment. Only stayed one night but recommend. Walk to BTS in 5 mins. Also great street food close by, ask the tuk tuk driver to take you there.",527
20869092,2019-10-09,"The service staff was not exactly professional (not sure if they are special needs staff, but if yes, please inform us). The cold dish was passable, the fish was overcooked, the noodles was clumpy and the yam paste was incredibly sweet (double the sugar anyone?).",528
20869092,2019-10-10,"Good place, clean room, near by MRT station<br/>Very recommended",529
20869092,2019-10-10,Water dripping sound all night long . Uncomfortable staying,530
20869092,2019-10-10,"Extremely bad experience as my Patagonia jacket was stolen during my 4 day stay! And, absolutely no help was provided in terms of finding it. Breakfast was also not provided although the online posting says that it is included. Ants everywhere within the property. The check-in lady (Grace) shouted on me for calling her to check in early.",531
20869092,2019-10-10,"Very dirty bed sheet, smelly blanket, pillow case got saliva mark and smell of saliva. Means never change new before guest in. Disgusted place to sleep. Lobby area have old uncle always smoke. Will make your shirt super smelly.",532

HUMAN HAIRS on the sheets and towels! We asked for clean sheets and they gave us these sheets with literally a pile of human hairs inside. They keep their 隆掳clean laundry隆卤 in the emergency staircase ON THE FLOOR! Proof is added in pictures and videos HEALTH HAZARD!",535
20869092,2019-10-13,"The place is wonderfully designed, filled with amenities, and is sparkling clean. They provide food delivery, free transportation to and from the nearby BTS station and has wonderful customer service. Great stay!",536
20869092,2019-10-14,"Wonderful apartment, clean ,location not in the famous shopping center area but is perfect  for us just 3 station away to reach there. But we mostly took Grab to everywhere in Bangkok, so convenience. Some of famous restaurant do delivery too, you may chrck out foodpanda and grabfood. We arrived 1.30am and check in is smooth and easy. I will be back to this apartment in future! defitnately!",537

20869092,2019-10-18,"I had a very bad experience. I emailed to ask about reservation for August 2020. Nobody called me. When I called in to ask after a few days, the staff gave me really bad attitude. And when I requested to speak with manager, she said manager is not keen to do business. Really horrible services to chase guests away!",542
20869092,2019-10-19,The Appartement was exactly like you can see in the pictures and it was very clean.,543
20869092,2019-10-21,"The hotel reception staff were rude and dismissive. When checking in, the female receptionist behaved so rudely I was shocked. When checking out, I handed in my key, I had no response, so I had to ask if the check out was complete. I actually think they don隆炉t want customers returning. Management need to teach them to be polite and helpful. The only courteous person was the doorman.",544
20869092,2019-10-21,"Cheap place, but lacks basic stuff like non-smelly rooms. Rooms smell of cigarettes and the bathroom stinks always. Weird logic of paying charges for the whole stay upon checking in and not giving you a proof of payment, just added to the welcome. The reception staff is neither truthful nor upfront. I won't recommend this place for anyone.",545
20869092,2019-10-22,Great,546
20869092,2019-10-22,Great,547
20869092,2019-10-23,"The apartment is great. Place is quiet and has privacy. Comfortable, clean and nice. The receptionist service is good too.

Recommended to everyone too!",548

20869092,2019-10-25,"What an amazing place to stay! So close to the BTS line but away from all the craziness. Also we arrived at midnight and checking in was a breeze. If you stay here and like coffee, stop by Gwin Coffee shop! They are super nice and the coffee is amazing! Thank you Suchada Team for an amazing start to the trip.",551
20869092,2019-10-25,Provide a bit of room for luggage storage during the stay.,552

20869092,2019-10-30,"Amazing location, nice modern place. The bed is extremely comfortable and the AC works amazing! Easy check in process and if you need anything Bangkok patio is just a call away. They offer tuk tuk services to the closest BTS station too. Highly recommend!",558
20869092,2019-11-02,Very good value and well maintained apartment. It has all you need. A bit far out from.the major sites but very good for getting to and from the airport. The staff at the patio where you check in are lovely and very helpful. The sky train is 5 minutes walk or they provide a free tuk tuk. There are some places to eat nearby but I went 4 stops on the sky train to the Siam complex where they have a superb selection of restaurants. All in a great place to stay,559
20869092,2019-11-03,"Very nice accomodation, very friendly staff and great location!",560
20869092,2019-11-03,"Extremely tiny rooms, rude night staff, and dirty bed sheets. ***Must avoid for staying with family.*** Only pro is Great location but the hotel is practically invisible to the naked eye even if you are right outside it .",561
20869092,2019-11-04,Gorgeous room with exceptional service. Additional services such as tuktuk ride to train and letting us leave ur luggages in the hotel really made our stay so much better. Will definitely stay here again when we come back to bangkok!,562
20869092,2019-11-04,Quiet and clean place which you can have a good night rest at end of the day,563
20869092,2019-11-05,This place was great! Everything was very clean and there was plenty of storage space for luggage and any stuff you have! It was really nice having the free Tuk Tuk to the BTS station too. It is more in a residential neighborhood which at first seemed weird for us but we ended up really liking it. It was quiet and easy to get around! Having the security 24/7 made us feel very safe and looked after. The front desk even scheduled a taxi for us at a reasonable price to get us to the airport! Everything working out perfectly! Thank you for all of the communication and wonderful stay!,564
20869092,2019-11-07,As expected. Cost performance is high. Value for money. Clic to find out!,565

20869092,2019-11-12,The place is good and the staffs are very friendly. They have free taktak to the nearest BTS station. The closest exit does not have any lift or escalator. If you walk from the hotel to the station it takes 10 mins.,573

20869092,2019-11-13,The apartment makes me feel like home.  The layout is really good.  All the area are sectioned out yet well functioned.  The place is really clean and fully equipped.  Everything works well.  Though it is a bit further in to the street but the tuk tuk service to the BTS is quick and always ready so it is not a problem accessing anywhere in BKK.<br/>I had a great stay and love to recommend this place.  Hope I have a chance to come back and stay again (I think it is always booked up). <br/>PS. The massage place downstairs is great too!!,575
20869092,2019-11-14,It's a great stay with a decent pool. We love the breakfast delivery by the front concierge across the street. Only 30 baht to deliver to your door and everyone is so nice. It is not a central location to Bangkok however that is a good thing not to be in such a noisy area. BTS is minutes away from central Bangkok. Would stay again!!,576
20869092,2019-11-14,Doesn隆炉t even deserve 1 star. Poor service. They don隆炉t care to guide the tourists. Reaching room will literally need a map. No body to guide you to your room. No room service. Staff is useless. No information.,577

20869092,2019-11-20,"Private room is only one lower queen bed and one table and chair, no windows, no tv. A/C. Very basic and expensive for the ""private room"" you must share bathroom amd showers. I don't recommend this place, you have to leave/remove your shoes outside before enter the hostel. I found out better hotel and options in the same area for the same or less price. Be aware that you can catch any fungus on your feet due ppl is walking bare foot on permises.",589
20869092,2019-11-21,"Clean, great location, any amenities you may need. Very easy to get to the train, and all staff are helpful if you need anything. Several restaurants, cafes, convenience stores and bars within walking distance. We will definitely be staying again next time, if we can!",590

20869092,2019-11-23,Great Airbnb! Comfiest bed ever!! The staff at The Patio were very helpful - communication with Suchada was prompt & so easy. Thank you for your hospitality!,592
20869092,2019-11-23,Moldy smell horrible room. How can they claim they renovated two years ago. And won隆炉t refund even if I contacted them one month ago five days after bookings don隆炉t book here. I am sure you can find a better deal than this horrible hotel,593
20869092,2019-11-24,A very nice apartment in a central location. Thank you very much and will definitely check this out the next time I will be in Bangkok!,594
20869092,2019-11-25,"Super clean - convenient walk to BTS - quiet - liked the fact i could pick up English channels on the TV - definitely felt safe - able to wash a load of clothes in the unit - comfortable bed - my only dislike is that it is not walkable to the main downtown area, you have to take the BTS but at the same time the trade off is the nice neighborhood and convenience to DMK airport (<200 THB) - staff is very helpful with questions and booking a ride",595
20869092,2019-11-25,The apartment was super clean und comfy and it was great located. Furthermore the hospitality was more than great.,596
20869092,2019-11-26,"Clean room with everything you need in a great location. Would definitely recommend, and would definitely stay here again.",597
20869092,2019-11-26,"This is a hotel with an off-site condo (where you'll stay). This is nice because everything is legitimate and safe. It's clean, nice, comfortable. BTS Ari is close by and that area has a lot of nice coffee shops and restaurants.",598
20869092,2019-11-27,"Amazing place very cozy and beautifull,clean and secure !<br/>Very close to downtown whit a great view !<br/>Thanks a million",599

20869092,2019-11-27,Superb apartments! Especially I like big windows and trees right outside,601
20869092,2019-11-27,"I booked one night here with plans to travel to Phuket the next day. My plans changed, and I ended up needing to stay an extra night but was unavailable to book online due to no availability. I messaged Suchada directly to see if she had another apartment available for me to stay in. She ended up reserving another night for me in the same room so I didn't have to pack and unpack again. This apartment is a short drive to and from both airports and close to everything on our itinerary. The place was very clean and the bed was very comfortable, perfect for two people. The team in the lobby was very helpful with booking grab taxis for us wherever we needed to go, and they offered free luggage storage too. I read so many great reviews about the massages downstairs, so glad we had time to get one! Amazing, and reasonably priced too. Overall great apartment!",602
20869092,2019-11-28,We had a great time here! The place is beautiful and so easy to get to. The pool is not to be missed!,603
20869092,2019-11-29,"Great place! We will be staying here again when we get the chance. Check in is easy, even when we got in late at night they were available and accommodating.

20869092,2019-11-29,"Great apartment, very well equipped and comfortable. Helpful and polite staff. We had a great stay.",605
20869092,2019-11-30,Everything about this place is as pictured. Their communication is great and there are a lot of added extras. They greet you with a map of Bangkok as well as cards that show the address in Thai for cab drivers. They had some snacks in the room and bottled water in the fridge for our arrival. They are also available via phone if you need anything during your stay. I would highly recommend staying here.,606
20869092,2019-11-30,"Very well located close to the BTS train station, this is a great value place to stay offering luxury accommodation at a decent price. For what is a very noisy city, it offers a Bangkok rarity: a quiet place to stay. Staff are great: every request we had was met instantly. Well recommended.",607
20869092,2019-12-02,"I was searching for a good hotel for my stay with family at Bangkok. I found significant problems with cleanliness with all the big names like Ramada, Ambassador etc. Then I found this Airbnb property. The property was extremely clean and host was really helpful. The location and services are top notch. The property is very close to SIAM Paragon. (Sea Aquarium and Madam Tussauds -  100 Baht via Grab).",608
20869092,2019-12-02,Room was as advertised. Very generous with complimentary waters and cup noodles. Staff was super responsive and helpful in booking a taxi to the airport. Would stay again!,609
20869092,2019-12-02,"Great serviced apartment, filled with the amenities you need. Walking distance to the BTS and an in-house free tuktuk ride available to the station. The place is spacious, has a very comfy bed and great shower. There is also a lovely pool on the fifth floor. Will definitely recommend for its value for money.",610
20869092,2019-12-03,Great stay. Very kind and helpful staff. They let us leave our baggage and even take a shower long after the check out time which was a really nice touch before our long haul flight. Highly recommended!,611
20869092,2019-12-03,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Everyone here was so incredibly helpful and the apartment was just as gorgeous as the pictures. The pool was always empty so it felt like it was my own. I also absolutely love that they provide room service, which is even a better value than some of the affordable restaurants I've been to.<br/><br/>Highly recommend!",612
20869092,2019-12-05,Nice place,613
20869092,2019-12-07,Everything was perfect. We had a pleasant stay.,614
20869092,2019-12-09,"My husband and I stayed here for a couple of days and it was the perfect place for arriving late from a late flight. Check in was so smooth and well explained! Awesome WiFi, clean place and had everything we needed for a couple days. Very close to everything!",615
20869092,2019-12-09,"Exactly as in the pictures, quick walk to BTS, perfect place to stay in Bangkok",616
20869092,2019-12-11,Great appartment!,617
20869092,2019-12-11,Exactly what we were looking for!,618
20869092,2019-12-11,Horrible. Its a scam. Not a place as advertised,619
20869092,2019-12-12,Picture looks deceiving. Room is small and not clean. Found an underwear or might be a sock underneath our bed,620
20869092,2019-12-12,Would not recommend. We booked the room with the outdoor tub and it isn隆炉t what was pictured. Bathroom has visible mould. Room is dusty and dirty and outside tub is dirty and exposed to neighbouring rooms. There was even a lizard crawling around when we came back.,621
20869092,2019-12-14,"Location is great! Although the apartment is not right next to the BTS, loved that they provided free tuk tuk service! Would stay here again the next time we are in BKK!",622

20869092,2019-12-17,Very nice place and in a perfect location about for using sky train also only a little over a mile from MBK and Siam for your shopping needs also very spacious clean and comfortable definitely exceeded my expectations.,626
20869092,2019-12-17,"Worse experience ever. Had to walk 20mins for a swimming pool which was located 1km outside the hotel. Got so many mosquitoe bites on the way. Room was too hot, aircon wasn隆炉t working right. The whole place just looks like a run down haunted hotel. Would never come back. Would recommend u guys to spend ur money elsewhere for retreat.",627
20869092,2019-12-18,Great location and great house. Swimming pool and gyms also there which makes it way better.,628
20869092,2019-12-18,Great place to stay if you want to explore the Ari area. Loads of fabulous restaurants in the area. Go to Olive Tree cafe right next door for good coffee and really nice wholemeal croissants!,629
20869092,2019-12-18,It looked all the same as pictures but there is a bed bug and unfortunately we are not happy with staying here.,630
20869092,2019-12-18,Best location : situated in right place to local visits and airport. <br/>Business class maintenance of room.<br/>I strongly recommend this place!,631
20869092,2019-12-18,"Horrible experience I ever have! The Underwear, towers are hanging everywhere at the shower room just like a refugee camp. The room are totally dark and no handle in my capsule, I almost fall down from the upper deck when I wake up at night. I found most of the staffs are living there, maybe those backpackers stay there paid by working for them. Maybe that隆炉s why many good comments about staffs!!",632
20869092,2019-12-19,"Great place, extraordinary hospitality from Suchada and the team! The flat looks exactly like the photos, very bright and clean. <br/><br/>The massage parlour in the building was great and the tuk-tuk service from and to the BTS were brilliant. <br/><br/>I can highly recommend this apartment and will be coming back again.",633
20869092,2019-12-20,Great place to stay. Close to BTS and very clean. Good neighborhood too.,634
20869092,2019-12-20,"One thing I love about this apartment is the location. It's a 10mins walk away from the BTS station. It makes it easy for us to travel to most of the places such as Pratunam, Chatuchak etc.",635
20869092,2019-12-21,"We had originally booked four nights at this Airbnb, however, we ended up checking out the first day. The photos look nicer than the room actually is. The building is all rented out on Airbnb so you may get a room that is not the same as the one in the pictures. Our room was dark, and the bathroom was tucked away in the back and very small and dark. I am extremely sensitive to smell, and the towels all smelled in the room. The pool looked nice in photos, but it does not look nice in person. The area also is not good. There is nothing to do in the area and it seemed sketchy.",636
20869092,2019-12-21,"Great place with nice facilities.<br/>Visit the massage place downstairs, it's very good!",637
20869092,2019-12-21,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. RACIST STAFF.,638

20869092,2019-12-25,"Place is as described, clean, and easily findable. Very easy to travel around the city from this central location. Would stay here again!",644
20869092,2019-12-25,It was awesome! I wanted to stay more but reservation was full for months. I can realize why it's so popular. Staffs were really kind and house was clean and amazing! Couldn't be better! :),645
20869092,2019-12-25,"Place was very classy, clean and comfy.<br/>Very near to local markets and metro. Best place to stay with family.",646
20869092,2019-12-25,"Would not recommend this hostel at all. They intially had me in a bed next to a leaking AC. Floor was all wet and could not get to my bed without stepping in the puddle. They moved me to a bed with stains, hairs, and dirt. Very disorganized and chaotic environment. Cleanliness of everything was about a zero.",647
20869092,2019-12-26,Great space. Helpful staff. Would recommend to family and friends.,648
20869092,2019-12-26,"The room smelled so bad and everything was super mushy and smelly, all the time. Ridiculously tiny room (14m2), I almost couldn隆炉t get in with my luggage. If you need a place for more than 2 nights then I隆炉d say find something else. You cannot open windows, it can be loud due to noises and traffic from outside.",649
20869092,2019-12-26,"Worst scenario, worst Christmas vacation, it will remain the most unpleasant moment of our life. Unable to stay, after turning in round in sort of giant labyrinth, we found our room, open the door and decided instantly to run away. The room was evoking a jail cell with a king size white bed stuck-up in a corner, a disgusting rising smell resulting from an extreme humidity, the perfect nightmare. Of course, we lost our booking and probably our incomprehensible deposit at the arrival considering that everything had been paid before reaching the hotel. In short, my advice, don't book, don't come there.",650
20869092,2019-12-27,"We had a great stay at Suchada's, the room was clean and they provided hop on ride from the apartment to the BTS. The location was excellent and extremely accessible to the main attractions. Highly recommended.",651
20869092,2019-12-28,"Here, expect to be greeted with a warm welcome and to stay in a room just as advertised; very clean, very comfortable and delightfully simple. Great staff will ensure you have a peaceful stay and have all you need!<br/>Bonus massage located in the same building: definitely take advantage of a Thai massage here!",652

20869092,2019-12-29,Very nice clean place,654
20869092,2019-12-30,"Great place, we stayed on the 5th floor just next to the pool but there was hardly any noise. Felt safe. If you use Grab for transport, it's pretty convenient and the accommodation gave very good value.",655
20869092,2019-12-30,Close to BTS Sanam Pao. Made our stay so much easier. Pool on 5th floor is lovely and overlooks some Bangkok skyline. Would defo recommend if you would like a quiet place to stay while in Bangkok,656
20869092,2019-12-31,Nice and clean flat,657
20869092,2019-12-31,Wonderful place to stay.  Incredible host.  Met our every expectation.  Thank you.,658

20869092,2020-01-02,"Nice location not far from BTS Sanam pao station,with all the necessary appliances, quiet and clean",662
20869092,2020-01-02,Went there for staycation bed was not clean gave me itch. Toilet dirty I don't know if they even clean there were stains on the wall of the toilet.,663
20869092,2020-01-04,Very clean and comfortable place. The bed was big and very comfortable.  It was nice that they provided room service and there was a massage place right outside the door. Would recommend this place.,664
20869092,2020-01-04,"The apartment is very nice with everything you need including a king size bed. A bit disappointed with the small space around the pool area with only two loungers, but a great place to cool off and relax if you get one of them. Very nice pool. Staff at main building very helpful. Order from the take-out food menu one night.  Excellent, cheap and lots!",665
20869092,2020-01-04,Great place with good cost efficiency.,666
20869092,2020-01-05,Disappointed,667

20869092,2020-01-06,"- Check-In: Smooth and easy<br/>- Amenities: Great, loved the rooftop pool! <br/>- Location: Perfect if you plan to take the BTS Skytrain. They even have a free tuk tuk to shuttle you to and from. It's also located near MBK and Siam Paragon which was nice for us when we didn't want to be out in the humidity. As far as its location from the Grand Palace, Reclining Buddha, and Wat Arun, it's a bit of a trek by public transit, so we just called a taxi.<br/>- Staff: All very courteous <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend staying here, it's not a touristy location but the BTS makes it easy to get around, and it also offers lots of local eats as well!",670
20869092,2020-01-07,"Fantastic all the way around. Easy check in, lovely people, great apartment. The bed was amazing. We will be back!",671
20869092,2020-01-08,"Awesome and clean place to stay. Everything was so nice except for two things. <br/>1) address : If you are using a (Hidden by Airbnb) map function available from airbnb app, it could possibly bring you to the wrong place. I already let the host know. Be make sure if this is fixed.<br/><br/>2) smelly towel : although it was so convenient as plenty of towels are provided, would be great if it smells okay.<br/><br/>Overall, i am satisfied with this stay, and willing to recommend this to friends",672
20869092,2020-01-08,Amazing apartment. Could not ask for more. They provided the best service and the apartment was well clean and organized. Tuktuk service was very convenient and it really helps to get around. Overall in my opinion this is the best Airbnb,673
20869092,2020-01-09,Lovely little apartment. Easy check in process! And luckily we were able to also check in earlier than expected which was nice after a flight. The sky train is within walking distance but if you like you can take a tuk tuk which is provided free of charge.,674
20869092,2020-01-09,Rude staff. Especially the unty asking your room number when u wanna take breakfast. U call this service?,675
20869092,2020-01-11,We had a great stay! The apartment is very beautiful and clean and perfectly located to discover the city of Bangkok. The staff was super friendly and communication with Suchada went always smooth. Highly recommend this place!,676
20869092,2020-01-12,"Suchada's place is very modern, clean, and comfortable. All the apartment staffs are very helpful and friendly. We arrived very early at around 8 am so we were still a half day ahead to check in but we could take a shower at the apartment shower room, which was really nice after a long flight. Also, when we couldn't turn on the TV, one staff came to the room right away and fixed the problem. Suchada's place is an apartment but with the level of comfort of staying in a hotel. I would definitely recommend Suchada's place to my friends who would visit Bangkok.",677
20869092,2020-01-13,Great location and personable service,678
20869092,2020-01-13,This is my second stay. <br/>The room is spacious and comfortable,679
20869092,2020-01-13,"The unit was very clean. Although we were in a different building than I had expected, the building we were in had a massage studio at the first floor and it was one of the best massages I received when I was in Thailand.",680
20869092,2020-01-14,"I booked Suchada's place last minute and they were able to help me out with quick respond. The check in/out was a lot easier than expected. This is a nice private luxury place. The owner is thoughtful and provided us with snack. There is also a free service tuk tuk for local areas too. Overall, great place for a quiet couple who's looking for a quiet night.",681
20869092,2020-01-15,Reception - check-in excellent. Couldn't have asked for a better welcome.,682
20869092,2020-01-15,"I was seldom in such a dump. The rooms are unclean, I had to change my room 5 times. as an apology there were two tangerines, a bottle of iced tea and a small can of Pringles. The first room was moldy. In the second, ants were running across the bed, in the third, water was dripping from the overhead light. After consultation with the hotel manager, I was assigned a room that had been ""cleaned especially for me"". At the front desk, I also overheard other guests complaining about missing items and bad smells. To top it off, I found a spot on the bed sheet which, upon closer inspection, may have turned out to be a bed bug. This dump isn't worth a penny.",683
20869092,2020-01-18,"Great clean place , nearby bts (sky train) , location is pretty strategic , will be back soon , thanx",684

20869092,2020-01-18,The apartment was clean and the check in process was smooth. The pool was nice to cool off from the heat. We used grab and taxis often to get to the tourist spots as they were not within walking distance. We would definitely come back!,686

20869092,2020-01-20,Very helpful host. Apt is in a great location to visit Chatuchak Weekend Market or an easy excursion to Ayutthaya.  Very close to BTS.,688
20869092,2020-01-20,"Don't be fooled by the name or price, this is absolutely a budget hotel. The rooms aren't large enough to swing a cat without causing it a traumatic brain injury. The hotel doesn't provide bottled water and want more money than the Hilton do for breakfast. Dissapointed. Will not return.",689
20869092,2020-01-21,"A thoroughly enjoyable stay. The apartment was spotless and clean, large comfy bed and we had everything that we needed. <br/><br/>Apartment has a washing machine, fridge/freezer and hob. <br/><br/>Some nice additional touches including bottles of water, coffee and some noodles<br/><br/>The swimming pool was great, located on the 5th floor and always empty when we used it which was nice. <br/><br/>Location really close to BTS. We used the cut through via Abloom hotel opposite Bangkok patio which lets you cut straight through rather than walking around, although they do provide a free tuktuk. <br/><br/>Would definitely stay again next time we are in Bangkok",690
20869092,2020-01-23,We loved our stay! Communication was quick and check in from the start was easy. The apartments are walking distance to some restaurants and a mall and we had a nice massage that was located within our building. The space of our room was just right for two people and it was nice to have the amenities of a washing machine as well and some appliances. It was modern and clean. I would definitely stay here again!,691
20869092,2020-01-24,"This place is great, very clean and stylish. Pool right outside perfect for me as I wanted a relaxing holiday. Close to food stalls and seven eleven. The Tuktuk service is a great option!",692
20869092,2020-01-24,"Location is convenient and quite, close to tramway. The appliances and reno in the apartment are older than expected. <br/>Really loved the massage shop in the building. <br/>Overall a good place to stay.",693
20869092,2020-01-26,My 3rd stay here - great hospitality once again from the staff and the room was as clean as when I first stayed here. Appreciate the small gestures like complimentary bottles of water and snacks!,694

20869092,2020-02-02,"The apartment has a comfort location near BTS. We were greeted at the reception. Filling in all the forms didn't take much time.

20869092,2020-02-02,A female staff here was absolute garbage and rude. Keep 隆掳suggesting隆卤 and repeating that we void our booking even after we say nobody is going to sneak in. After we checked in our room was infested with cockroaches :-) cancelled the rooms Never ever coming again :) There are other better places out there with way better service. Learn how to have manners first :),704

20869092,2020-02-04,"Very bad hotel , service is bad ,very rude receptionists , they assigned us rooms direct on a construction field that was working 24 hours , the noise never stopped, and when we complained about it , they promised to solve but didn't do anything about it , even we asked for rooms that are near to our kids but they refused",709
20869092,2020-02-06,Dont worry about the distance between your stay and BTS because they provide the tuk tuk service to bring you 2 ways between the destination,710

20869092,2020-02-08,Excelent aparment!,712
20869092,2020-02-08,We enjoyed our stay at the Bangkok Tryp condo.  The surrounding Ari area had great cafe options and easy accessibility to the BTS station.  We had a great experience at Sabaya massage located on the ground floor.,713

20869092,2020-02-09,This was great for my one night between my island hopping and flying home. Very easy to check in and it was a nice touch to be provided with plenty of bottled water. Very close to the sky train so convenient for getting around the city.,719
20869092,2020-02-10,I can recommend! The apartment had everything we needed. Thanks for having us!,720
20869092,2020-02-10,Booked here for 1 night didnt even manage to get 1hr sleep as we had a window on the street and there were people talking all night long and it seemed like they were in our room as the glass insulation is so poor. Stay at Ibis instead!,721
20869092,2020-02-12,I like this place. My second  time here. Good feeling. Nice host. Highly recommended!,722
20869092,2020-02-12,We had good time there. Thanks to Suchada and team.,723

20869092,2020-02-15,"Sleeping pods don't have doors as advertised, but instead there is a curtain. It is extremely hot as it does not have dedicated AC. Breakfast was unatended and limited. and premises are not tidy",726
20869092,2020-02-15,"This service apartment is with dim light, water coming from shower is super slow. In room dining food is cold. Do not recommend staying here at all.",727

20869092,2020-02-17,"Buen alojamiento es amplio (aunque las fotos pareciera un poco mas amplio de lo q es en realidad), hay cocina, lavadora (nos dejaron detergente sin costo), el aire acondicionado esta bueno. Queda a 2 cuadras aprox del metro.",729
20869092,2020-02-17,"We are highly recommend this place to any other travelers in Bangkok. The room is sparkling clean with complete facilities. They provided Shop, shampoo, clean tower, tooth brush and paste, water bottles, etc (similar with hotel standard). Location also quite good, located only a few station from Siam and chatuchak weekend market. <br/>This place guys!!!",730
20869092,2020-02-17,"What a horrible experience隆颅 many cockroaches in the room, luckily they were not in the next room we received隆颅(receptionist did not even say sorry) 隆颅terrible dump smell on the floor when you leave the elevator隆颅 dirty room and carpet was not clean- hair on the ground when we got the room隆颅. Walls in the bathroom not cleaned properly隆颅. Wifi did not work at all隆颅 hotel needs some care and renovation and not only taking money from customers隆颅 wake up please!! One star for location隆颅.",731
20869092,2020-02-17,Poor wifi quality. Behavior of hotel Staffs are worst. Strongly Not recommended.,732
20869092,2020-02-18,"Fantastic place! Very clean, modern and spacious, highly recommend! <br/><br/>Great location, not too far from the airport and close to the main areas via BTS like Siam and Ari which we liked visiting. <br/><br/>Very helpful staff, showed us around so we knew where everything was when we first arrived and allowed us to keep our heavy suitcases in the lobby for safekeeping after checkout while we enjoyed our last day in Bangkok. <br/><br/>We also enjoyed the complimentary tuk tuk to and from the train station.",733
20869092,2020-02-18,"10 stars for this place!<br/><br/>- Affordable<br/>- Accessible<br/>- Our room was ready 4 hours before our check in time<br/>- Front Desk employees were friendly and helpful<br/>- Super clean<br/>- Spacious<br/>- Bed is super duper comfy<br/>- TV, Aircon, Washing Machine, hair dryer, and hot water worked perfectly<br/>- The swimming pool was nice and clean<br/>- It is near a local market where food is much much cheaper! 20 Baht for Iced Coffee and Iced Matcha, 60 Baht for Sticky Rice, 50 Baht for Rice Meals! <br/><br/>Highly recommended!<br/><br/>Thank you!",734
20869092,2020-02-20,"Not reach my expectations, location is good. but the rooms old and smell Not well.",735
20869092,2020-02-20,"The room smells, TV doesn't work, interior is very dusty.",736
20869092,2020-02-21,"Their photos are misleading, the room is not as big as it looks like. We booked a room for 3 people including an extra bed. There is absolutely no place to walk once the extra bed was placed, and when asked about it, we did not receive any help with the situation. Very small rooms and misleading pictures from the owners have been posted.",737
20869092,2020-02-21,"Most all the reviews mentioned about the location is perfect, but when your hotel is not good then nothing is perfect, tiny pigeon whole room, wardrobe maybe good for small babies but not for adults, room stinks but I guess when you stay for more than a day you may get used to it, small tiny bathroom. Not sure how come this is 4 star hotel. I would have given 5 star rating if this was lower than 1 star hotel. I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay here, one last but not the least the breakfast no words for that super Amazing (NOT)",738
20869092,2020-02-21,Filthy room. Underside of the beds have NEVER been cleaned (littered with dirt and food remains). Rooms had a strong smoke smell and were much smaller than expected. Shower had warm-water at best. Breakfast was very poor. Corridors smelt like fish. Rooms were only cleaned once in our 4 night stay. Very very disappointing. Avoid.,739
20869092,2020-02-21,"I would not recommend this hotel. Despite booking for 12 nights, I was rejected flatly for a room upgrade. Reason given was that my stay was very long. This means that room upgrades are given only for short stays? I have not encountered any reason like this in any hotel before. Not to mention the toilet was not clean, hair was found on the wall.",740
20869092,2020-02-22,"Really nice and spacious apartment with kitchenette included. Close to public transport, pool included, isolated from the Main Street traffic. Best to use as a base when you visit Bangkok. Nothing to complain really.",741
20869092,2020-02-22,"Clean space with easy check-in and, if necessary, luggage storage after check out. We had a late flight out of Bangkok and Suchada arranged to have our luggage stored for the day. This was very convenient.  Would recommend again.",742
20869092,2020-02-23,Great place to spend a few days in Bangkok. Very clean and 3 min from sky train. I definitely recommend it.,743

20869092,2020-02-24,Great relaxing place to spend the night at!,745
20869092,2020-02-25,Thank you for a wonderful stay. This was our first time in Bangkok and we were very happy with our stay. The place was clean and had everything we needed. The pool was a nice way to cool off and relax. The bed was very comfortable! Loved the spa!!,746

20869092,2020-02-29,Very stylish apartment for very reasonable price. Location is a bit further away from attractions and the more lively districts but a ride with the close skytram fixes that issue.,749
20869092,2020-02-29,Great place.,750
20869092,2020-02-29,"Very much fulfill the 4C's when choosing for an accommodation: Clean, Comfortable, Convinient, Cheap (affordable!). The location is within walking distance to the sky train and 7-11 (they do provide free tuk tuk shuttle to the station) and the room (studio) is clean and well equipped. You can basically live there for long term! Will definitely be back.",751
